# Chicago-Cyclist-Project

Scenario:

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

The marketing director has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 

Main Task:

My main objective is to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
